# VERTEX
VERTEX is an app that allows for communication among 3 types of individuals: students, teachers, and parents. The goal of this app is to ensure that this communciation is as smooth as possible, so that students can have all of the educational resources to succeeed. Hence our motto: VERTEX...the point to connect.

# Description
* **Student:** students will have the opportunity to see all of their upcoming events, communicate with their teachers, and join new clubs.
* **Parent:** parents will be able to access their child's events and report absences for their child
* **Teacher:** teachers will be able to contact their students, add events for clubs which they are advisers of, and view any upcoming events for these clubs.

# Motivation
We created this project to solve important student needs that apps, such as Remind and Instagram, could not solve themselves. We understand the frusturation that many students may experience as they use these apps, so we wanted to make the experience better. Furthermore, we wanted to get teachers and parents involved because to provide the best educational experience possible. 

# Code
We have used [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=CjwKCAiAwc-dBhA7EiwAxPRylOL06vqVy2r9-7r07Bz3MYqicIY42nP4Jw0dpZ_y20WWA4i7uxSiFRoCJNIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) for our frontend. Flutter allows for development on iOS and Android platforms. We used Firebase for our backend development. Firestore and Google Authorization platforms were used.
