# VERTEX
VERTEX is an app that allows for communication among 3 types of individuals: students, teachers, and parents. The goal of this app is to ensure that this communciation is as smooth as possible, so that students can have all of the educational resources to succeeed. Hence our motto: VERTEX...the point to connect.

# Description
* **Student:** students will have the opportunity to see all of their upcoming events, communicate with their teachers, and join new clubs.
* **Parent:** parents will be able to access their child's events and report absences for their child
* **Teacher:** teachers will be able to contact their students, add events for clubs which they are advisers of, and view any upcoming events for these clubs.

# Motivation
We created this project to solve important student needs that apps, such as Remind and Instagram, could not solve themselves. We understand the frusturation that many students may experience as they use these apps, so we wanted to make the experience better. Furthermore, we wanted to get teachers and parents involved because to provide the best educational experience possible. 

# Code
We have used [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=CjwKCAiAwc-dBhA7EiwAxPRylOL06vqVy2r9-7r07Bz3MYqicIY42nP4Jw0dpZ_y20WWA4i7uxSiFRoCJNIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) for our frontend.

# Features
* **Upcoming Events:** Lists all of the users' upcoming events based on the activities they are enrolled. The events are shown on a calendar. A description of the event is provided. The dates and times are listed as well. This ensures that the user is up to date on all school-related information.
* **ASB Page:** A separate page just for announcements/events from the school are listed because these tend to be very important. Dates and times of events are listed along with a description of the event. The ASB's Instagram page is also listed.
* **Feedback:** Users can provide feedback about the app, so that we can make future updates for the app. 
* **View Licensing & Terms of Use:** Users can view our licensing & terms of use, so that they are aware of all of the policies associated with our app.
* **Help:** Users can navigate to the help page if they need any help understanding how to access certain elements of the app. 
* **Icons:** Various icons are used throughout the app to ensure that the user is able to easily navigate between the pages and understand what each page does.
* **Photo Messaging:** Students and teachers are able to send photos to each other through our messaging page. This ensures that teachers can be fully involved in the students' learning process.
* **Reporting Absences:** As many parents know, reporting their students' absences can be quite tedious. VERTEX ensures that this process is simple and quick from both parents and administration.
* **Bookkeeping:** School bookkeeping is unorganized and lacks UI to display items being purchases. Vertex's bookkeeping page solves all of these problems.
